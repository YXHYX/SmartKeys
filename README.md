# SmartKeys
SmartKeys is an application that shortcuts the launch of a program by pressing a button usign an Arduino.

It communicates with an Arduino over the serial port to listen to the buttons, you can set which programs you want to launch once a button is pressed.
if you find my code messy and not clear, im sorry.
